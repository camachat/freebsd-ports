Caffe2 is a lightweight, modular, and scalable deep learning framework.
Building on the original Caffe, Caffe2 is designed with expression, speed,
and modularity in mind.

Caffe2 aims to provide an easy and straightforward way for you to experiment
with deep learning and leverage community contributions of new models and
algorithms. You can bring your creations to scale using the power of GPUs in
the cloud or to the masses on mobile with Caffe2's cross-platform libraries.
