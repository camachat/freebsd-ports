gkrellm-xkb is a convenient plugin designed to integrate with
GKrellM, the popular GNU/Linux system monitor. This plugin provides
a visual indicator of the currently active national keyboard layout
by displaying a small country flag directly within the GKrellM
interface. For users who frequently switch between different keyboard
layouts (e.g., for multilingual typing or programming), gkrellm-xkb
offers an immediate and unobtrusive way to ascertain the active
layout at a glance. This enhances usability and helps prevent
typing errors or confusion when working with multiple input methods,
making it a valuable addition for international users or those
with specialized keyboard needs.
