XTar is a graphical utility built with the Motif toolkit, designed
for intuitive viewing and manipulation of 'tar' archives, including
those that are compressed. It provides a user-friendly interface
where the contents of a selected archive are clearly displayed
in the main window. Users can interact with the archive through
a variety of options accessible via pulldown and popup menus,
allowing for operations such as extracting files, adding new
content, deleting existing entries, and inspecting archive metadata.
XTar offers a visual alternative to command-line 'tar' operations,
making archive management more accessible and efficient for users
who prefer a graphical environment.
