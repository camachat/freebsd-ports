utftools is a valuable collection of command-line utilities that
provide enhanced functionality for working with text files encoded
in UTF (Unicode Transformation Format). This package includes
UTF-aware implementations of common tools such as 'wc' (word count),
'fmt' (text formatter), 'expand' (tabs to spaces), and 'unexpand'
(spaces to tabs). Unlike their traditional counterparts, these
utilities are specifically designed to correctly interpret and
process multi-byte Unicode characters, ensuring accurate results
when dealing with internationalized text. By offering proper
handling of various UTF encodings, utftools is an essential
resource for developers, system administrators, and users who
regularly work with diverse character sets and multilingual content.
