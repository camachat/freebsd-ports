asbutton is a compact and highly functional swallowable applet
designed for desktop environments utilizing a Wharf or dock.
This innovative utility allows users to embed multiple small,
customizable buttons directly within a single dock icon. Each
of these miniature buttons can be configured to launch a specific
application or execute a command upon a single click. By consolidating
several application launchers into one space-saving icon, asbutton
helps to declutter the desktop and streamline workflow, providing
quick and efficient access to frequently used programs without
consuming excessive screen real estate. It is an ideal solution
for users who prioritize a clean desktop and efficient application
management.
