cpuid is a comprehensive utility designed to identify and display
detailed information about the central processing unit (CPU) installed
in a system. It provides insights into various CPU characteristics,
including vendor, model, family, stepping, features, and cache
configurations. The tool has been rigorously tested across a range
of processors from manufacturers such as Intel, AMD, and Cyrix.
Notably, it can detect and report the presence and status of the
Pentium III serial number "misfeature" if it is enabled, offering
valuable diagnostic information for system administrators and users
interested in their hardware specifications.
