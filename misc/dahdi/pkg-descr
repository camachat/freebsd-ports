DAHDi, which stands for Digium/Asterisk Hardware Device Interface,
is a crucial open-source device interface technology. It provides
the necessary drivers and utilities to enable communication and
control of various telephony interface cards, including those
manufactured by Digium and other compatible vendors. Primarily
used in conjunction with the Asterisk open-source PBX software,
DAHDi facilitates the integration of physical telephony hardware
(such as analog and digital telephony cards) with software-based
telecommunication systems, allowing for robust voice and data
communication solutions.
