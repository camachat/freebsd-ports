ftdi-eeprom is a specialized utility designed for programming
the Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM)
of FTDI (Future Technology Devices International) USB chips.
These chips are commonly used in various electronic devices
to provide USB-to-serial, USB-to-parallel, or other USB interface
functionality. The ftdi-eeprom tool allows users to write custom
configuration data to the EEPROM, enabling the modification of
device descriptors, vendor and product IDs, serial numbers,
and other operational parameters. This is crucial for customizing
FTDI-based hardware, ensuring proper device recognition, and
tailoring its behavior for specific applications.
