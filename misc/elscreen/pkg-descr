ElScreen is a powerful and versatile utility designed to enhance
the user experience within GNU Emacs by introducing advanced
screen management capabilities. Much like the familiar GNU Screen
for shell environments, ElScreen allows Emacs users to create
and manage multiple virtual screens or "window configurations"
within a single Emacs instance. This enables efficient organization
of various buffers, frames, and windows, facilitating seamless
switching between different work contexts without cluttering
the display. It significantly improves productivity for Emacs
users who frequently work with numerous files and tasks, providing
a structured and flexible workspace.
