wmpal is a lightweight and minimalist dockapp designed for the
Window Maker desktop environment. Inspired by the Black Box
application 'bbpal', wmpal serves primarily as a decorative
or simple informational applet for your desktop's dock. While
it may not offer extensive functionality, its purpose lies
in providing a compact and aesthetically pleasing addition
to the Window Maker interface. It caters to users who appreciate
the clean and efficient design philosophy of Window Maker
and seek small, unobtrusive utilities to personalize their
desktop without adding unnecessary complexity.
