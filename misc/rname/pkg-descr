rname is a straightforward command-line utility designed to execute
a specified program under an alternative name. This functionality
can be particularly useful in scenarios where a program's behavior
is dependent on the name by which it is invoked, or when you need
to bypass certain environment checks. It provides a flexible way
to test different execution paths or to integrate programs into
scripts that expect specific command names, without altering the
original executable file.
