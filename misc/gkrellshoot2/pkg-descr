gkrellshoot2 is a versatile plugin designed to enhance the functionality
of GKrellM 2.x and later versions. This utility integrates two
convenient features directly into your GKrellM monitor: a screen
lock button and a screen capture ("shoot") button. The screen
capture functionality leverages ImageMagick to efficiently take
screenshots, providing a quick way to document your desktop.
Additionally, gkrellshoot2 can be seamlessly configured to interact
with your preferred screen saver program, with known compatibility
for popular options like Xlock or xscreensaver. This plugin offers
a streamlined approach to managing screen security and capturing
desktop visuals, making it a practical addition for users who
require these actions readily accessible from their system monitor.
