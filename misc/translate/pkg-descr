translate is a convenient command-line utility implemented as a
Perl script, designed to provide quick and easy language translation.
It leverages the powerful Google Translate service to translate
a given string or word from one language to another. Users can
specify the source and target languages, making it a versatile
tool for various translation needs directly from the terminal.
This script is particularly useful for developers, writers, or
anyone who frequently encounters foreign language text and requires
on-the-fly translations without needing to open a web browser.
It offers a lightweight and efficient way to bridge language barriers
in a command-line environment.
