lc is a venerable and widely-used command-line utility that serves
as an alternative to the standard 'ls' command for listing directory
contents. Originating from the University of Waterloo in the mid-1970s,
lc offers a distinct approach to displaying file and directory
information. While performing the same fundamental task as 'ls',
it often provides a different set of default behaviors, output
formats, or command-line options that some users may find more
convenient or efficient for their specific workflows. Its long
history of use attests to its reliability and enduring utility
in various computing environments.
