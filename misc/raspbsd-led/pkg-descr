raspbsd-led provides a set of essential tools for controlling and
manipulating the built-in LEDs commonly found on various ARM-based
single-board computers, including popular platforms like the
BeagleBone Black and potentially Raspberry Pi devices running
FreeBSD. These utilities enable users to programmatically flash,
toggle, and manage the status of these onboard indicator lights.
This package is particularly useful for embedded systems development,
debugging, and creating visual feedback mechanisms for custom
applications running on these ARM boards, offering a straightforward
interface for hardware interaction.
