rpl is a powerful and flexible command-line utility designed for
efficient text replacement across multiple files within a Unix-like
environment. It excels at finding and replacing specified strings
with new ones, offering robust features such as recursive directory
scanning. This allows rpl to process all files found within a given
directory and its subdirectories, making it ideal for large-scale
code refactoring, configuration file updates, or batch text
modifications. Furthermore, users can refine their search by
limiting operations to files with specific filename suffixes
(e.g., '.html', '.c', '.txt'), ensuring precise control over
which files are modified. rpl is an indispensable tool for developers,
system administrators, and anyone needing to perform quick and
reliable text substitutions across numerous files.
