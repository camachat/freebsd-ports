gkrellm-gamma is a specialized plugin designed to extend the
functionality of GKrellM, a popular GNU/Linux system monitor.
This plugin provides users with direct control over their monitor's
gamma correction settings within the XFree86 environment. By
integrating seamlessly with GKrellM, gkrellm-gamma allows for
convenient, real-time adjustments to display brightness and
contrast characteristics, enabling users to fine-tune their
visual output for optimal viewing comfort or specific application
requirements. It is particularly useful for graphic designers,

and display management directly from their desktop monitoring tool.
