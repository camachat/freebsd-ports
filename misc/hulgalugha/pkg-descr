Hulgalugha is a unique text processing filter designed to introduce
stylistic "jerky" alterations to input text. It can be used for
various creative purposes, such as generating unusual dialogue,
simulating speech impediments, or adding a distinctive, erratic
flair to written content. This tool provides a fun and experimental
way to transform plain text into something more dynamic and
unconventional, suitable for artistic projects, game development,
or simply for amusement.
