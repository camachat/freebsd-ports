Deco is a robust, text-based file manager for Unix-like operating
systems, serving as a functional clone of the classic Norton Commander.
It provides a full-featured and intuitive interface for navigating
the filesystem, performing file operations such as copying, moving,
deleting, and renaming, as well as managing directories. Designed
for efficiency and ease of use in a terminal environment, Deco is
an excellent tool for users who prefer keyboard-driven interaction
and a powerful, yet lightweight, approach to file management.
