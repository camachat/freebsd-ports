Felis is a specialized command-line utility designed for concatenating
the contents of one or more files and outputting them as a single,
continuous line to standard output. Unlike traditional tools such
as 'cat', which preserve line breaks, Felis processes all input
files and presents their combined content without any newline
characters, effectively flattening the text into a single stream.
This unique behavior makes it particularly useful for scripting
and data processing tasks where a compact, single-line representation
of file contents is required, such as for log parsing or generating
single-line configuration strings.
