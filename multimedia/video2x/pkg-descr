Video2X – Machine Learning-Powered Video Super Resolution & Frame Interpolation Framework

Video2X is a powerful open-source framework designed to perform video super-resolution and frame interpolation using modern machine-learning models. Originally created for Hack the Valley II (2018) and maintained on GitHub, Video2X leverages state-of-the-art upscaling engines — such as Anime4K v4, Real-ESRGAN, Real-CUGAN, and RIFE — to enhance low-resolution video content into higher quality outputs with sharper details and smoother motion.

Unlike traditional upscalers that rely on simple interpolation or bicubic resizing, Video2X uses AI-driven models and Vulkan-accelerated backends to intelligently reconstruct image data and interpolate frames, enabling both resolution enhancement and improved frame rates. Version 6.x of the project is a complete rewrite in C/C++, introducing a faster, more efficient processing pipeline, cross-platform support (Windows & Linux), and improved output fidelity. Video2X supports multiple modes of operation — from basic filtering/upscaling to advanced frame interpolation — and can be run via command-line or integrated into automated workflows. Licensed under the GNU AGPL-3.0, Video2X is freely available for modification and redistribution, with a growing community contributing feature enhancements and algorithm support.
