Falkon was orignially known as Qupzila.

Falkon is a new and very fast QtWebEngine browser. It aims to be a lightweight
web browser available through all major platforms. This project has been
originally started only for educational purposes. But from its start, Falkon
has grown into a feature-rich browser.

Falkon has all standard functions you expect from a web browser. It includes
bookmarks, history (both also in sidebar) and tabs. Above that, you can manage
RSS feeds with an included RSS reader, block ads with a builtin AdBlock plugin,
block Flash content with Click2Flash and edit the local CA Certificates
database with an SSL Manager.

Falkon has a wide range of features supported by KDE Frameworks
and many integration points with KDE Plasma. A "-qtonly" flavor is
available without these features:
- spellchecking
- word completion
- crash reporting
- progress notifications
- KIO (virtual filesystem) support
- wallet integration
- content-sharing
